    # Guidelines for inlining
    # -- Inlining functions which have multiple case constructs can quickly
    #    turn out to be messy code generation nightmare.
    # -- Splitting a use site can occur when the inlined function is defined
    #    by different expression in different parts of the function domain.
    #    Functions which are defined by a single expression over the entire
    #    domain are good candidates for inlining.
    #    Example :
    #    f(x) = g(x-1) + g(x) + g(x+1) when (1 <= x <= N-1)
    #         = 0                      otherwise
    #    h(x) = f(x-1) + f(x) + f(x+1) when (1 <= x <= N-1)
    #         = 0                      otherwise
    #    Inlining f into h will result in splitting as shown below
    #    h(x) = g(x-2) + g(x-1) + g(x) +      when (2 <= x <= N-2)
    #           g(x-1) + g(x) + g(x+1) +
    #           g(x)   + g(x+1) + g(x+2)
    #         = 2*g(x-1) + 3*g(x) + 2*g(x+1)  when (x == 1)
    #           + g(3)
    #         = g(x-2) + 2*g(x-1) +           when (x == N-1)
    #           3*g(x) + 2*g(x+1)
    #         = 0                             otherwise
    #    For multiple dimensions and complex expression it gets ugly fast
    # -- Inlining without splitting is possible even when the function is
    #    defined by mutliple expressions. When the function references at
    #    the use site can all be proved to be generated from a single
    #    expression.
    #    Example :
    #    f(x) = g(x-1) + g(x) + g(x+1) when (1 <= x <= N-1)
    #         = 0                      otherwise
    #    h(x) = f(x-1) + f(x) + f(x+1) when (2 <= x <= N-2)
    #         = 0                      otherwise
    #    Inlining f into h will not result in splitting as shown below
    #    h(x) = g(x-2) + g(x-1) + g(x) +      when (2 <= x <= N-2)
    #           g(x-1) + g(x) + g(x+1) +
    #           g(x)   + g(x+1) + g(x+2)
    #         = 0                             otherwise
